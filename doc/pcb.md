## PCB

To create your own PCB, send the gerber files off to your favorite PCB fab. There is an interactive BOM at [ibom.html](ibom.html), but most values are marked on the board itself.  All components can be sourced from the usual low cost Chinese vendors (AliExpress, etc.).

This is the VGA connector I used, https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255799889288258.html

The Pico is mounted on 8.5mm tall 2.54mm female headers with 2.54mm male headers.

For the video input, you can use any standard right angle 2.54mm spaced header or even solder the wires to the board. I went with an 5p XH2.54 connector which clips together a bit more securingly

and then you can use the precrimped cables to make your input cable with a standard DIN 9 connector.  I sleeved the cable to make it look a little nicer, but that's optional.

## Case

The case is a simple snapfit design done in DesignSpark.  It's optimized to be printed at 0.2mm layer height with no need for supports.
